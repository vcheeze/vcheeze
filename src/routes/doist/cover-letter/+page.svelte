      <h1 class="mt-4 mb-2">ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Peter.</h1>
      <h1 class="mb-12">Here's why I'd be a great addition to Doist.</h1>
    </header>

    <h2>Why I'd be a natural fit at Doist</h2>
    <ul class="my-4 list-disc space-y-2 pl-8">
      <li>
        I build high-impact, intuitive solutions that solve complex problems, because <strong
          >simplicity attracts, retains, and endures</strong
        >.
      </li>
      <li>
        I thrive in <strong>remote, asynchronous environments</strong> - I mastered autonomous work growing
        up as a homeschooler, and it has translated seamlessly into my professional career, where I led
        and scaled remote teams to deliver high-quality, user-focused products.
      </li>
      <li>
        I communicate and collaborate effectively, in writing, in person, and in code :)
        Productivity isn't just speed; it's the harmony of effectiveness and efficiency. Clarity in
        direction makes efficiency worthwhile.
      </li>
      <li>
        I am <strong>obsessed with performance and reliability</strong>. My work is test- and
        performance-driven, and I constantly iterate to meet the evolving standard of excellence in
        web development.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What I can do for Doist</h2>
    <ul class="my-4 space-y-2">
